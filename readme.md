# Image-based Food Classification with Deep Neural Networks

<hr>

In this work, we propose a deep learning model for image-based food
classification, e.g., determining whether a picture is that of a Sandwich or
Sushi. Our models, as will be subsequently explained, is built on top of a
convolutional neural network (CNN) that we use for training and evaluating the
model.

Compete instructions for installing and running the code can be found in the IPython notebook: <a href = 'https://github.com/Staano/image_food_classification/blob/master/cookpad_image_classification.ipynb'>cookpad_image_classification.ipynb</a>
